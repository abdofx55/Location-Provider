# Location-Provider
This package is used to get location updates (java & kotlin)   
It merges 3 providers (Network , GPS , Fused) to get the best result on all mobiles      
GPS provider & Network provider are the best and the faster when absence of the internet , also they don't need google play services so they work perfectly on Huawei devices     
Fused Location Provider is the best when there is internt , but it needs google play services so it doesn't work on Huawei devices
